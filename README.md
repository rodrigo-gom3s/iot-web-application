# IoT Web Application
A web application for managing sensors and actuators in a city

The application features a web interface that displays the city's status based on data received from sensors. It can also trigger actuators.

Communication between the application and the sensors/actuators is handled through a PHP API, allowing both the web application and the Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices to process and respond to the received data.
